# Breast Cancer Prediction

This project uses machine learning to predict breast cancer based on features of cell nuclei present in the breast cancer dataset.

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to build a logistic regression classifier that can accurately predict whether a tumor is benign or malignant based on certain features. The dataset used is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset.

## Dataset

The dataset contains 569 instances of tumors, with 30 features each. The features are computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They describe characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the image.

## Requirements

The project requires the following Python packages:

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib (optional, for visualizations)

## Project Structure

- `breast_cancer_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the code for the project.

## Acknowledgments

- Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset
